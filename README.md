# odin-landing-page
This is the 'Landing Page' project completed as a part of The Odin Project (TOP).

This project was very difficult when I first started it because I did not have a
purpose behind what I was creating. When I decided to create a resume landing page,
this gave me a purpose and made this project much easier to section off and create.

I highly recommend breaking this project apart into each section and once everything
is on the page in html, create the css for each section.
